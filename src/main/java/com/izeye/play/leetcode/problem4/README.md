The final result is as follows:

```
Runtime: 2 ms, faster than 100.00% of Java online submissions for Median of Two Sorted Arrays.
Memory Usage: 45.2 MB, less than 95.09% of Java online submissions for Median of Two Sorted Arrays.
```

The performance from the result seems okay but the problem requires O(log (m+n)) as follows:

> The overall run time complexity should be O(log (m+n)).

But the solution is using O(m+n), so this doesn't seem to solve it completely.
